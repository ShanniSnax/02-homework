# Shanni Suissa's Portfolio

I created this website as my own online portfolio and virtual resume. This will be where future employers, collaborators and fans can view my work. I was originally motivated by the idea of being able to provide so much information about myself with just a simple URL. This will streamline any networking and interviewing I will be doing down the road and allows me to save on paper. 


## Usage 

This website should be used to either view my work, connect via social media or to contact me via email. The easy to navigate menu bar at the top of the website will guide you through the various sections and pages.
